/* Write a for loop to print all elements in courseGrades, following each element with a space (including the last). Print forwards, 
then backwards. End each loop with a newline. Ex: If courseGrades = {7, 9, 11, 10}, print:

7 9 11 10 
10 11 9 7 

Hint: Use two for loops. Second loop starts with i = courseGrades.length - 1. (Notes)


Note: These activities may test code with different test values. This activity will perform two tests, both with a 4-element array. */
